Given a specific extension and a directory, write a shell script called extrm.sh to remove the extension
from the name of any file with that specific extension. For example, assume that the extension jpg
is given as input to the script along with a path to a directory, and the given folder contains two files
that have that extension, named image1.jpg and image2.jpg. The script in extrm.sh should rename
these two files these two files to image1 and image2, respectively.
